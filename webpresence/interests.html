    <div><h3>Painting</h3>
    <p>I have always enjoyed art, but painting is my favorite. I have done a couple coolers in the past, and I regularly pain paddles for people in my business fraternity. Currently, I am working on an 8 ft long folding table for my friends and I. It includes logos for our favorite places in dekalb, characters from our favoite movies, and little inside jokes. I am hoping to finish it before August.</p>

    <p>My dad has been teaching me how to play pool for a couple years now. I am hoping to start beating him more often.</p>
   
  
  </div> <div> <h3>Water Polo</h3>
    </div><div><p>I played water polo during highschool and I loved it! I played wing, so I got to participate in the swim off every quarter. I don't play now, but I enjoy watching team USA play in the olympics.   </p>
    
    
    </div><div><h3>Roadtrips</h3>
    <p>My boyfriend and I enjoy going on roadtrips with our friends. This past year we went to Tennessee and Colorado. My dream vacation is to go to Iceland (we would obviously have to fly, so it's on the back burner right now while we finish up school).</p>

<article>   

    <p>One of my favorite things to do is travel with my  friends. Since we are college kids and low on funds, we end up driving to our destinations. We recently took trips to the Smokey Mountains in Tennessee, and to the Rockies in Colorado. Iceland is on my bucket list.</p>

    <p>Planning a trip can be a pain in the ass with this group of people. In order to make sure things run smoothly, make sure everyone has a task. There is a lot to do! Decide who is driving, and who's car floor will be covered in beef jerky wrappers and Chex Mix. Book airbnbs and look up things to do in the area. Someone should research restaurants, and also gas stations when you get low on gas. Make sure you pack enough snacks to feed the U.S Army. Someone should also know boy scout level first aid/survivor skills, because sometimes members of the group are painfully suburban.</p>
